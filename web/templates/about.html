        <h3>Does Memo have access to my private keys?</h3>
        Private keys are stored encrypted with the user's Memo password.
        The key needs to be unencrypted to sign transactions. Memo does not have
        access to the private keys, so it is critical for users to keep a backup in
        case the Memo password is lost.

    <div>
        <a name="reputation"></a>
        <a name="connectivity"></a>
        <h3>What is Shared Connections?</h3>
        Shared Connections represents how connected a Memo account is from the perspective of your account.
        Currently it is the percentage of those you follow who follow the account.
        In other words, it's the number of shared first-degree connections.
        We have a goal to increase the value of the reputation system over time as we identify additional useful inputs.
